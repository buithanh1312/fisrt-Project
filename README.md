# Remark
### This project is an example for me to practice about spring boot framework.
*** 
###### In this project I built this entire application excluding the front-end part. I used API to get request, post, put and delete.
###### Next is a service layer mainly for business logic and then a data access layer responsible for connecting to any database.
***
###### This project is my first project about Spring Boot, so there will be many shortcomings, in addition, I have referenced the source code from Amigoscode.
